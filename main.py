    This is a copy of the template bot for Q2 2025 Metaculus AI Tournament.
    The official bots on the leaderboard use AskNews in Q2.
    Main template bot changes since Q1
    - Support for new units parameter was added
    - You now set your llms when you initialize the bot (making it easier to switch between and benchmark different models)

    The main entry point of this bot is `forecast_on_tournament` in the parent class.
    See the script at the bottom of the file for more details on how to run the bot.
    Ignoring the finer details, the general flow is:
    - Load questions from Metaculus
    - For each question
        - Execute run_research a number of times equal to research_reports_per_question
        - Execute respective run_forecast function `predictions_per_research_report * research_reports_per_question` times
        - Aggregate the predictions
        - Submit prediction (if publish_reports_to_metaculus is True)
    - Return a list of ForecastReport objects

    Only the research and forecast functions need to be implemented in ForecastBot subclasses.

    If you end up having trouble with rate limits and want to try a more sophisticated rate limiter try:
    ```
    from forecasting_tools.ai_models.resource_managers.refreshing_bucket_rate_limiter import RefreshingBucketRateLimiter
    rate_limiter = RefreshingBucketRateLimiter(

    await self.rate_limiter.wait_till_able_to_acquire_resources(1) # 1 because it's consuming 1 request (use more if you are adding a token limit)
    ```
    Additionally OpenRouter has large rate limits immediately on account creation

             Important tips: 
             - Your 20th percentile forecast should be greater than the lower bound of {question.lower_bound}.
             - Your 80th percentile forecast should be less than the upper bound of {question.upper_bound}.
             - Have a wide range for your tails since you might not have all the information, or might be misunderstanding something.
             - Historically your 10th and 90th percentiles have been far too narrow. Try to be more calibrated by making them twice as wide as you think is necessary.
             - Like a good forecaster use your own judgment!
